    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of breakfast sausage</li>
        <li>1.5 cups finely diced celery</li>
        <li>.75 cup of margarine, melted</li>
        <li>8 cups white bread crumbs</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, Drain.</li>
        <li>Melt margarine. Add enough to sausage drippings to make one cup</li>
        <li>Saute; onions and celery in margarine/dripping mixture until onion is tender. 
            DO NOT BROWN. Stir in about 1/3 bread cubes. 
            Put in big bowl and add remaining bread cubes, 
            poultry seasoning, and pepper. Watch your hands, it's hot. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Stuff turkey. You can also omit the sausage, 
                increase the bread cubes to 9 cups, and add a 
                teaspoon or two of salt. 
                You can also add apples, giblets, oysters, 
                etc. This recipe is very adaptable. When cooking extra in the oven, 
                place the stuffing in a buttered casserole dish, and place in a pan of hot water. 
                Cover, and baste with turkey drippings occasionally. It comes out really good.</li>
